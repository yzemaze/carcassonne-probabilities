Probabilites of tile draws in Carcassonne

## Whatâ€™s here?
[LibreOffice Calc sheet](draw-k-out-of-K.ods) featuring draw probabilities of exactly/at least k out of K desired tiles still present in N total tiles remaining. [cf. [ hypergeometric distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_distribution)]

[python script](draw-a-before-b.py) simulating (2p Carcassonne) tile draws and printing corresponding stats. It calculates probabilities of drawing 1 out of n tiles before the other player does draw either 1 of them or 1 out of m different tiles.

## Problems, ideas etc.
